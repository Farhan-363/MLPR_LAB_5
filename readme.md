# Lab 5: Spring Semester 2026
## Name : Farhan Hussain
## Id : U20240196

## Aim 
The aim of this lab is to detect faces in a group photograph using haar Cascade Classifier , extract color-based features like Hue and Saturation from detected faces and pply k-Means clustering to group faces based on similarity and in the end do the cluster assignment for the template image.

## Methodology
1. Face detection : Applied haar cascade face detection. Bounding boxes around the face.
2. Features extraction : mean hue and saturation values for each face
3. KMeans clustering : cluster labels and centroid position
4. Template classification : According to the hue and saturation assign the template image to the cluster.

## Key Findings
1. Face detection results : Haar Cascade classifier effectively identified frontal faces with consistent lighting
2. Clustering analysis : cluster 0 : red color, 
                         cluster 1 : green color
3. Template image classification : The template image is correctly assigned to the respective cluster.
